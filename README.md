# Android-Generic Project Manager

## What Is This?

Android-Generic Project Manager (AGPM), is a tool that makes it easier to build and configure AOSP based projects. 

AGPM provides a number of features that can help you save time and effort, including:
 - Will check for missing dependencies and ask to install any missing. 
 - Automatic repo init: AGPM can automatically initialize a new AOSP project or update an existing one.
 - Python virtualenv support: AGPM can wrap your project in a Python virtualenv, which allows you to install packages and run scripts without affecting the rest of your system.
 - Update checking: AGPM can check for updates to your project's repositories and notify you of any changes.
 - Private project modules: You can add your private project modules to private_projects/api-##/* and they will be loaded into the list.
 - Much More

AGPM is designed to be flexible and extensible, so you can add your own project configurations and features. 

Currently, we support the following projects:
 - AOSP
 - Bliss ROM
 - Lineage OS
 - Bliss OS
 - Your Private Projects


We have a planned features list a mile long, and we are always working to add support for more projects. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue our repository.
